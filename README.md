# net-device-catalog
This project in currently under improvement. All notes so far have been made for self direction for vision of the project
and education between myself and the CTO that I'm collaborating with this on. 


Catalog using a new API to keep inventory of our product.
Initialize to be a Node.js project. Explore node commands to run and complete project.
Need to initialize JSON package since we are using Node.js.
Using v20 of node. Ours is "long-term supported". These types are great because they guarantee longer terms of stability and supp

Three big things making AWS what it is. 
1. Serverless options - serving customers via AWS Buckets for websites etc

2. Lambda function (AWS Lambda) - Small area of execution that's only billed while running the execution (cloud scale billing).
   One issue with these is that sometimes they'll go into "hibernation". Once reawakened, it needs some time to get back to full 
   speed. This time does get billed along with it's first command/function.

3. What we are using is "Express JS", one of the most popular API frameworks in java ecosystem.
